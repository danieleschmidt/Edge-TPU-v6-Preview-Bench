# 🚀 Edge TPU v6 Benchmark - Deployment Notes

## ✅ Successfully Committed Changes

**Branch**: `terragon/autonomous-sdlc-quality-gates`
**Commit**: `690d07c` - feat(enhanced-sdlc): complete autonomous SDLC enhancement with advanced features

## 📋 Changes Successfully Pushed

### 🔄 CI/CD Workflow Relocation
- **File**: `.github/workflows/ci-cd-enhanced.yml` → `deploy/workflows/ci-cd-enhanced.yml`
- **Reason**: GitHub App lacks `workflows` permission to modify `.github/workflows/`
- **Solution**: Moved to `deploy/workflows/` for manual deployment when ready

### 📁 Enhanced Files Already in Repository
All enhanced SDLC files were previously committed and are tracked:

✅ `src/edge_tpu_v6_bench/core/secure_config.py` - Secure configuration management  
✅ `src/edge_tpu_v6_bench/core/enhanced_benchmark.py` - AI-driven performance optimization  
✅ `src/edge_tpu_v6_bench/core/monitoring_enhanced.py` - Production monitoring stack  
✅ `src/edge_tpu_v6_bench/research/advanced_experimental_design.py` - Research framework  
✅ `deploy/k8s/enhanced-deployment.yaml` - Kubernetes deployment manifests  
✅ `AUTONOMOUS_ENHANCED_SDLC_SUMMARY.md` - Complete enhancement summary  

## 🎯 Next Steps for Manual Deployment

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline Setup
```bash
# Copy the workflow to .github/workflows/ when ready:
cp deploy/workflows/ci-cd-enhanced.yml .github/workflows/
```

### 2. Required GitHub Secrets
Set these in repository settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` - For deployment notifications
- GitHub token already available as `GITHUB_TOKEN`

### 3. Kubernetes Deployment
```bash
# Apply the enhanced deployment:
kubectl apply -f deploy/k8s/enhanced-deployment.yaml
```

### 4. Required Environment Variables
Production deployment needs:
- `EDGE_TPU_API_KEY` - API key for Edge TPU access
- `EDGE_TPU_ENCRYPTION_KEY` - Encryption key for secure operations
